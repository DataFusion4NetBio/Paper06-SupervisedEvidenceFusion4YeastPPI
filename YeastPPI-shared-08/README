The files we used to extract features for yeast protein pairs 
were downloaded from different related papers. 
You should be able to find more recent/upated new version 
( than those shared in this directory ) from the internet.

---------------------------------------

HOW TO USE?

- You could use codes and ORF_list in ./0yeast_gene_list
   to generate your reference protein pairs list 
   
- You could use the scripts 
  "Batch_feature_summary_ExtractWrapper.pl" and "Batch_feature_ExtractWrapper.pl"
  to generate features for a file containing a list of yeast pairs. 
  
- In each line of this file, 
  ORF1	ORF2	1/0 
  The last item means this is positive protein-protein interaction pair(1) or not (0).
