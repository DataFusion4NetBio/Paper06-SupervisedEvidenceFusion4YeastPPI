This directory contains results of PSI-BLAST query that uses the protein sequence of every ORF in S.cerevisiae to query NCBI's non-redundant(nr) protein dataset.

PSI-BLAST results for individual genes can be viewed by accessing the 'PSI-BLAST Results' link in the Comparison Resources pull-down menu of each SGD Locus Page.

The analysis is described in detail at:

This file was generated on 11-02-2004.

The columns of this tab-delimited file contain the following information:

1) S. cerevisiae systematic name 

2) start coordinate (amino acid position) of aligned region of query
sequence (S. cerevisiae protein sequence)

3) stop coordinate (amino acid position) of aligned region of query
sequence (S. cerevisiae protein sequence)

4) start coordinate (amino acid position) of aligned region of target
sequence

5) stop coordinate (amino acid position) of aligned region of target
sequence

6) percent aligned (percent of the length of the query gene contained
in the aligned region)

7) score (natural log value of the Expectation value)

8) target identifier 

9) taxon id for species of origin of target sequence

10) species name for species of origin of target sequence
