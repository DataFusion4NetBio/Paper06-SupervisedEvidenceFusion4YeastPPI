This directory contains the results of NCBI BLASTP analysis using each
S. cerevisiae protein sequence to query predicted protein sequences
from several model organisms.

Model Organism BLASTP Best Hits results for individual genes may be
viewed by accessing the 'Model Organism BLASTP Best Hits' link in the
Comparison Resources pull-down menu of each SGD Locus Page.

The analysis is described in detail at
http://www.yeastgenome.org/help/bestHits.html

==================
best_hits.tab
==================

The columns of this tab-delimited file contain the following information:

1) S. cerevisiae systematic name 

2) start coordinate (amino acid position) of aligned region of query
sequence (S. cerevisiae protein sequence)

3) stop coordinate (amino acid position) of aligned region of query
sequence (S. cerevisiae protein sequence)

4) start coordinate (amino acid position) of aligned region of target
sequence

5) stop coordinate (amino acid position) of aligned region of target
sequence

6) percent aligned (percent of the length of the query gene contained
in the aligned region)

7) score (natural log value of the Expectation value)

8) target gene identifier 

9) taxon id for species of origin of target sequence

10) species name for species of origin of target sequence
